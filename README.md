This project delivers a complete Hospital Information Management System (HIMS) built using pure SQL 💾. It establishes a robust relational database schema to streamline core hospital operations, including the management of Doctors, Patients, Appointments, and Billing ✨. The system is designed with a clear structure of master and transactional tables, and it includes foundational analytical queries for operational reporting, providing a scalable and efficient data backend for healthcare administration 🏥.
